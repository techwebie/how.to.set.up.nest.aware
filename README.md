The Nest Cam is an easy-to-use security camera that plugs into any outlet and connects directly to your Wi-Fi so that you can keep tabs on your home, no matter where you are. Here’s how to set it up.

1. Once you have your Nest Cam unboxed, download the Nest app to your phone. It’s free and it’s available for iOS and Android devices.
2. Once downloaded, open it up and select **“Sign up”**.
3. Enter in your email address and come up with a password for your Nest account. Then tap **“Sign up”**.
4. Select **“I agree”** to agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and tap “Continue” at the bottom of the next screen.
5. When prompted, give your home a name in the app and tap **“Next”**.
6. The next screen will ask you for your address, but your zip code is the only thing that’s required. Hit **“Next”**.
